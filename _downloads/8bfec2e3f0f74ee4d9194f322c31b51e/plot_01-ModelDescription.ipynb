        "Conceptual Overview\n-------------------\n\nThe conceptual idea motivating the desire to parameterize neural power spectra is the\nidea that there are multiple distinct 'components' within neural field data,\nand we would like a way to explicitly and specifically model these different\naspects of the data.\n\nMore specifically, the FOOOF model conceptualizes the neural data as a combination\nof aperiodic and periodic (oscillatory) activity.\n\nThe goal of the model is to measure these component, separately and explicitly,\nfrom frequency representations of neural field data (neural power spectra).\n\n\n"

        "Aperiodic Component\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo fit the aperiodic component, we use an exponential function,\nwhich we will refer to as $L$.\nNote that this function is fit on the semi-log power spectrum\n(linear frequencies and $log_{10}$ power values).\n\nThe exponential is of the form:\n\n\\begin{align}L = 10^b * \\frac{1}{(k + F^\\chi)}\\end{align}\n\nOr, equivalently:\n\n\\begin{align}L = b - \\log(k + F^\\chi)\\end{align}\n\nIn this formulation, the parameters $b$, $k$, and $\\chi$\ndefine the aperiodic component, as:\n\n- $b$ is the broadband 'offset'\n- $k$ relates to the 'knee'\n- $\\chi$ is the 'exponent' of the aperiodic fit\n- $F$ is the vector of input frequencies\n\nNote that fitting the knee parameter is optional. If used, the knee parameter defines a\n'bend' in the aperiodic `1/f` like component of the data. If not used, the 'knee'\nparameter is set to zero. Without a 'knee' parameter, this is equivalent to fitting\na linear fit in log-log space to measure the 'slope' of the power spectrum (where the\nexponent = -slope).\n\nWe use this form since though neural data is often discussed in terms of having\n`1/f` activity, across broader frequency ranges, there is typically not a single\n`1/f` characteristic. Using this form allows for modeling bends in the power spectrum\nof the aperiodic component, if and when they occur.\n\nRelating Exponents to Power Spectrum Slope\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAnother common way to measure 1/f properties in neural power spectra is to measure\nthe slope of the spectrum in log-log spacing, measuring the 1/f as:\n\n..math::\n  NPS = ax + b\n\nWhere:\n\n- $a$ is the power spectrum slope\n- :math: `b` is the offset.\n\nNote that, when fitting without a knee, this can be considered equivalent to the\nexponential fits that we perform, where the slope relates to the exponent value as:\n\n..math::\n   \\chi = -a\n\n\n"

To fit these\nperiodic components, we use Gaussians.\n\nEach Gaussian, referred to as $G_n$, is of the form:\n\n\\begin{align}G_n = a * exp (\\frac{- (F - c)^2}{2 * w^2})\\end{align}\n\nThis describes each peak in terms of parameters `a`, `c` and `w`, where:\n\n- $a$ is the height of the peak, over and above the aperiodic component\n- $c$ is the center frequency of the peak\n- $w$ is the width of the peak\n- $F$ is the vector of input frequencies\n\n\n"
