        "FOOOF Settings\n--------------\n\nWith default settings, FOOOF is minimally constrained. It defaults as such\nsince there are not universal settings that work across all different recording\nmodalities. Appropriate settings also vary with power spectrum quality (noise,\nor effectively, the smoothness of the power spectrum), and frequency ranges.\n\nFor any given dataset, FOOOF will likely need some tuning of parameters\nfor optimal performance.\n\nTo do so, we suggest using a combination of the following considerations:\n\n- A priori constraints, given your data, such as the number\n  of peaks you expect to extract\n- Qualitative analysis, guided by examining the the plotted\n  model fit results, as compared to input data\n- Quantitative analysis, considering the model goodness of fit and fit error\n  (however, see note at the bottom regarding interpreting these metrics)\n\nTuning the model fits is an imperfect art, and should be done carefully, as\nassumptions built into the settings chosen will impact the model results.\n\nWe also recommend that FOOOF settings should not be changed between power\nspectra (across channels, trials, or subjects), if they are to be meaningfully\ncompared. We therefore recommend first testing out FOOOF across some\nrepresentative spectra, in order to select FOOOF settings, which you then keep\nconstant for the full analysis.\n\n\n"

        "Interpreting Model Fit Quality Measures\n---------------------------------------\n\nFOOOF calculates and returns a couple metrics to assist with assessing the\nquality of the model fits. It calculates both the model fit error, as the\nmean absolute error (MAE) between the full model fit (`fooofed\\_spectrum\\_`)\nand the original power spectrum, as well as the R-squared correspondence\nbetween the original spectrum and the full model.\n\nThese scores can be used to assess how the model is performing. However\ninterpreting these measures requires a bit of nuance. FOOOF is NOT optimized\nto minimize fit error / maximize r-squared at all costs. To do so typically\nresults in fitting a large number of peaks, in a way that overfits noise,\nand only artificially reduces error / maximizes r-squared.\n\nFOOOF is therefore tuned to try and measure the aperiodic component and peaks\nin a parsimonious manner, and, fit the `right` model (meaning the right aperiodic\ncomponent and the right number of peaks) rather than the model with the lowest error.\n\nGiven this, while high error / low r-squared may indicate a poor model fit,\nvery low error / high r-squared may also indicate a power spectrum that is\noverfit, in particular in which the peak parameters from the model may\nreflect overfitting by fitting too many peaks.\n\nWe therefore recommend that, for a given dataset, initial explorations\nshould involve checking both cases in which model fit error is particularly\nlarge, as well as when it is particularly low. These explorations can be\nused to set parameters that are suitable for running across a group.\nThere are not universal parameters that optimize this, and so FOOOF\nleaves it up to the user to set parameters appropriately to not\nunder- or over-fit for a given modality / dataset / application.\n\n\n"
