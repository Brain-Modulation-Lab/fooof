Candidate\npeaks are extracted in order of decreasing height, until some stopping criterion is met,\nwhich is controlled by the following parameters:\n\n**max_n_peaks (int)** default: infinite\n\nThe maximum number of peaks that can be extracted from a given power spectrum. FOOOF will\nhalt searching for new peaks when this number is reached. Note that FOOOF extracts peaks\niteratively by height (over and above the aperiodic component), and so this approach will\nextract (up to) the *n* largest peaks.\n\n**peak_threshold (in units of standard deviation)** default: 2.0\n\nThe threshold, in terms of standard deviation of the aperiodic-removed power\nspectrum, above which a data point must pass to be considered a candidate peak.\nOnce a candidate peak drops below this threshold, the peak search is halted (without\nincluding the most recent candidate).\n\n**min_peak_height (units of power - same as the input spectrum)** default: 0\n\nThe minimum height, above the aperiodic fit, that a peak must have to be extracted\nin the initial fit stage. Once a candidate peak drops below this threshold, the peak\nsearch is halted (without including the most recent candidate). Note that because\nthis constraint is enforced during peak search, and prior to final peak fit, returned\npeaks are not guaranteed to surpass this value in height.\n\nNote: there are two different height-related halting conditions for the peak searching.\nBy default, the relative (standard-deviation based) threshold is defined, whereas the\nabsolute threshold is set to zero (this default is because there is no general way to\nset this value without knowing the scale of the data). If both are defined, both are\nused and the peak search will halt when a candidate peak fails to pass either the absolute,\nor relative threshold.\n\nAperiodic Mode\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**aperiodic_mode (string)** default='fixed'\n\nThe fitting approach to use for the aperiodic component.\n\nOptions:\n  - 'fixed' : fits without a knee parameter (with the knee parameter 'fixed' at 0)\n  - 'knee' : fits the full exponential equation, including the 'knee' parameter\n\nVerbosity\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n**verbose (boolean)** default='True'\n\nWhether to print out status updates and warnings.\n\n\n"
