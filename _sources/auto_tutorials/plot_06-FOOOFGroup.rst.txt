06: FOOOFGroup
==============

Using FOOOFGroup to run FOOOF across multiple power spectra.


.. code-block:: default


    import numpy as np

    # Import the FOOOF object
    from fooof import FOOOFGroup

    # Import some utilities for simulating some test data
    from fooof.sim.params import param_sampler
    from fooof.sim.gen import gen_group_power_spectra








Fitting Multiple Spectra
------------------------

So far, we have explored using the FOOOF object to fit individual power spectra.

However, many potential use cases will have many power spectra to fit.

To support this, here we will introduce the FOOOFGroup object, which applies
the model fitting procedure across multiple power spectra.


Simulated Power Spectra
--------------------------

Before we start FOOOFGroup, we need some data. For this example, we will simulate some
test data. FOOOF includes utilities for creating simulated power-spectra, that mimic real data.

To do so, we will use a function called :func:`param_sampler` that takes a
list of possible parameters, and creates an object that randomly samples from
them to generate power spectra.

Note that if you would like to generate single power spectra, you can use
:func:`gen_power_spectrum`, also in `fooof.sim.gen`.

There are more examples and descriptions of using FOOOF to simualate data in the
`examples <https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/auto_examples/index.html>`_
section.



.. code-block:: default


    # Set random seed, for consistency generating simulated data
    np.random.seed(321)









.. code-block:: default


    # Settings for simulating power spectra
    n_spectra = 10
    f_range = [3, 40]

    # Set some options for aperiodic parameters
    #  These settings, as [offset, exponent] pairs are possible values for our simulated spectra
    #  Simulated spectra will have aperiodic parameters of [20, 2], [50, 2.5] or [35, 1.5]
    ap_opts = param_sampler([[20, 2], [50, 2.5], [35, 1.5]])

    # Set some options for peak parameters
    #  Generated power spectra will have either no peaks, a 10 Hz peak, or a 10 Hz & 20 Hz peak
    gauss_opts = param_sampler([[], [10, 0.5, 2], [10, 0.5, 2, 20, 0.3, 4]])








We can now feed these settings into :func:`gen_group_power_spectra`,
that will generate a group of power spectra for us.

Note that this function also returns a list of the parameters
used to generate each power spectrum.



.. code-block:: default


    # Simulate the group of simulated spectra
    #  Note that this function also returns a list of the parameters for each simulation
    freqs, spectra = gen_group_power_spectra(n_spectra, f_range, ap_opts, gauss_opts)








FOOOFGroup
----------

The FOOOFGroup object is very similar to the FOOOF object (programmatically, it inherits
from the FOOOF object), and can be used in the same way.

The main difference is that instead of running across a single power spectrum, it
operates across 2D matrices containing multiple power spectra.

Note that by 'group' we mean merely to refer to a group of power-spectra,
are not using the term 'group' in terms of necessarily referring to multiple subjects
or any particular idea of what a 'group' may be. A group of power spectra could
be spectra from across channels, or across trials, or across subjects, or
whatever organization makes sense for the analysis at hand.

The main differences with the FOOOFGroup object, are that it uses a
`power_spectra` attribute, which stores the matrix of power-spectra to be fit,
and collects fit results into a `group_results` attribute.

Otherwise, FOOOFGroup supports all the same functionality,
accessed in the same way as the FOOOF object.

Internally, it runs the exact same fitting procedure, per spectrum, as the FOOOF object.



.. code-block:: default


    # Initialize a FOOOFGroup object, which accepts all the same settings as FOOOF
    fg = FOOOFGroup(peak_width_limits=[1, 8], min_peak_height=0.05, max_n_peaks=6)









.. code-block:: default


    # Fit a group of power spectra with the .fit() method
    #  The key difference (compared to FOOOF) is that it takes a 2D array of spectra
    #     This matrix should have the shape of [n_spectra, n_freqs]
    fg.fit(freqs, spectra)

get_params
~~~~~~~~~~

To collect data across all model fits, and to select specific data results from this data
you can should the :func:`get_params` method.

This method works the same as in the FOOOF object, and lets you extract specific results
by specifying a field, as a string, and (optionally) a specific column of that data.

Since the FOOOFGroup object collects results from across multiple model fits,
you should always use :func:`get_params` to access parameter fits. The result attributes
introduced with the FOOOF object do not store results across the group, as they are
defined for individual model fits (and used internally as such by the FOOOFGroup object).



.. code-block:: default


    # Extract aperiodic data
    aps = fg.get_params('aperiodic_params')
    exps = fg.get_params('aperiodic_params', 'exponent')

    # Extract peak data
    peaks = fg.get_params('peak_params')
    cfs = fg.get_params('peak_params', 'CF')

    # Extract metadata about the model fit
    errors = fg.get_params('error')

Saving & Loading with FOOOFGroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FOOOFGroup also support saving and loading, with same options as saving from FOOOF.

The only difference in saving FOOOFGroup, is that it saves out a 'jsonlines' file,
in which each line is a JSON object, saving the specified data and results for
a single power spectrum.

Note that saving settings together with results will save out duplicated settings
to each line in the output file, corresponding to each individual spectrum in the group,
and so is somewhat inefficient. It is more parsimonious to save out a single settings file,
and a separate file that includes the results.



.. code-block:: default

    ==================================================================================================




Parallel Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FOOOFGroup also has support for running in parallel, which can speed things up as
each power spectrum is fit independently.

The fit method includes an optional parameter 'n_jobs', which if set at 1 (as default),
will run FOOOF linearly. If you set this parameter to some other integer, fitting will
launch 'n_jobs' number of jobs, in parallel. Setting n_jobs to -1 will launch in
parallel across all available cores.

Note, however, that running FOOOF in parallel does not guarantee a quicker runtime overall.
The computation time per FOOOF-fit scales with the frequency range fit over, and the
'complexity' of the power spectra, in terms of number of peaks. For relatively small
numbers of power spectra (less than ~100), across relatively small frequency ranges
(say ~3-40Hz), running in parallel may offer no appreciable speed up.

Progress Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a large number of spectra to fit with a FOOOFGroup, and you want to
monitor it's progress, you can also use a progress bar to print out fitting progress.

Progress bar options are:

- `tqdm` : a progress bar for running in terminals
- `tqdm.notebook` : a progress bar for running in Jupyter notebooks



.. code-block:: default


    # Run FOOOF across a group of power spectra, printing a progress bar
    fg.fit(freqs, spectra, progress='tqdm')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

Extracting Individual Fits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running FOOOF across a group of power spectra, results are stored as the FOOOFResults,
which stores (only) the results of the model fit, not the full model fits themselves.

To examine individual model fits, FOOOFGroup can regenerate FOOOF objects for individual
power spectra, with the full model available for visualization.



.. code-block:: default


    # Extract a particular spectrum, specified by index to a FOOOF object
    #  Here we also specify to regenerate the the full model fit, from the results
    fm = fg.get_fooof(ind=2, regenerate=True)









.. code-block:: default


    # Print results and plot extracted FOOOF model fit
    fm.print_results()
    fm.plot()

Conclusion
----------

Now we have explored fitting FOOOF models and running these fits across multiple
power spectra. Next we dig deeper into how to choose and tune the algorithm settings,
and how to troubleshoot if any of the fitting goes wrong.
