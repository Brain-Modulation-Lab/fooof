02: Fitting FOOOF Models
========================

Introduction to the module, beginning with the FOOOF object.


.. code-block:: default


    # Import numpy for loading data
    import numpy as np

    # Import the FOOOF object
    from fooof import FOOOF









.. code-block:: default


    # Load example data to use for this tutorial (a single example power spectrum)
    freqs = np.load('data/freqs.npy')
    spectrum = np.load('data/spectrum.npy')








FOOOF Object
------------

At the core of the module, which is object oriented, is the FOOOF object, which holds relevant
data and settings as attributes, and procedures to run the FOOOF algorithm as methods.

The organization is similar to sklearn:

- A model object is initialized, with relevant settings
- The model is used to fit the data
- Results can be extracted from the object


Calculating Power Spectra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FOOOF model operates on power spectra. FOOOF itself does not compute power spectra,
and so computing power spectra needs to be done prior to using the FOOOF module.

The model is broadly agnostic to exactly how power spectra are computed. Common
methods, such as using Welch's method to compute the spectrogram

If you need a module in Python that has functionality for computing power spectra, try
`NeuroDSP <https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/>`_

Note that FOOOF objects require frequency and power values passed in as inputs to
be in linear spacing. Passing in non-linear spaced data (such logged values) may
produce erroneous results.


FOOOF Example
-------------

The following example demonstrates fitting a FOOOF model on a single power spectrum.



.. code-block:: default


    # Initialize FOOOF model
    fm = FOOOF()

    # Set the frequency range upon which to fit FOOOF
    freq_range = [2, 40]

    # Run FOOOF: fit the model, print the resulting parameters, and plot the reconstruction
    fm.report(freqs, spectrum, freq_range)

    FOOOF WARNING: Lower-bound peak width limit is < or ~= the frequency resolution: 0.49 <= 0.50
            Lower bounds below frequency-resolution have no effect (effective lower bound is the frequency resolution).
            Too low a limit may lead to overfitting noise as small bandwidth peaks.
            We recommend a lower bound of approximately 2x the frequency resolution.

FOOOF Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above method 'report', is a convenience method that calls a series of FOOOF methods:

- :func:`fit`:  fits the FOOOF model
- :func:`print_results`: prints out the results
- :func:`plot`: plots to data and model fit

Each of these methods can also be called individually.



.. code-block:: default


    # Alternatively, just fit the model with FOOOF.fit() (without printing anything)
    fm.fit(freqs, spectrum, freq_range)

    # After fitting, plotting and parameter fitting can be called independently:
    # fm.print_results()
    # fm.plot()

            Too low a limit may lead to overfitting noise as small bandwidth peaks.
            We recommend a lower bound of approximately 2x the frequency resolution.





Model Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the FOOOF model is calculated, the model fit parameters are stored as object
attributes that can be accessed after fitting.

Following the sklearn convention, attributes that are fit as a result of
the model have a trailing underscore, for example:

- aperiodic\_params_
- peak\_params_
- error\_
- r2\_
- n\_peaks\_


Access model fit parameters from FOOOF object, after fitting:



.. code-block:: default


    # Aperiodic parameters
    print('Aperiodic parameters: \n', fm.aperiodic_params_, '\n')

    # Peak parameters
    print('Peak parameters: \n', fm.peak_params_, '\n')

    # Goodness of fit measures
    print('Goodness of fit:')
    print(' Error - ', fm.error_)
    print(' R^2   - ', fm.r_squared_, '\n')

    # Check how many peaks were fit
    print('Number of fit peaks: \n', fm.n_peaks_)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Aperiodic parameters: 
     [-21.89682937   0.76346863]

    Number of fit peaks: 
     4




Selecting Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also select parameters using the `get_params` method, which can be used to
specify which parameters you want to extract.



.. code-block:: default


    # Extract a FOOOF parameter with `get_params`
    err = fm.get_params('error')

    # Extract parameters, indicating sub-selections of parameter
    exp = fm.get_params('aperiodic_params', 'exponent')
    cfs = fm.get_params('peak_params', 'CF')

    # Print out a custom parameter report
    template = ("With an error level of {error:1.2f}, FOOOF fit an exponent "
                "of {exponent:1.2f} and peaks of {cfs:s} Hz.")
    print(template.format(error=err, exponent=exp,
                          cfs=' & '.join(map(str, [round(cf, 2) for cf in cfs]))))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    With an error level of 0.05, FOOOF fit an exponent of 0.76 and peaks of 9.75 & 13.46 & 15.81 & 19.49 Hz.




For a full description of how you can access data with `get_params`, check
the method's documentation.

As a reminder, you can access the documentation for a function using '?' in a
Jupyter notebook (ex: `fm.get_params?`), or more generally with the `help` function
in general Python (ex: `help(get_params)`).


Notes on Interpreting Peak Parameters
-------------------------------------

Peak parameters are labeled as:

- CF: center frequency of the extracted peak
- PW: power of the peak, over and above the aperiodic component
- BW: bandwidth of the extracted peak

Note that the peak parameters that are returned are not exactly the same as the
parameters of the Gaussians used internally to fit the peaks.

Specifically:

- CF is the exact same as mean parameter of the Gaussian
- PW is the height of the model fit above the aperiodic component [1],
  which is not necessarily the same as the Gaussian height
- BW is 2 * the standard deviation of the Gaussian [2]

[1] Since the Gaussians are fit together, if any Gaussians overlap,
than the actual height of the fit at a given point can only be assessed
when considering all Gaussians. To be better able to interpret heights
for single peak fits, we re-define the peak height as above, and label it
as 'power', as the units of the input data are expected to be units of power.

[2] Gaussian standard deviation is '1 sided', where as the returned BW is '2 sided'.


The underlying gaussian parameters are also available from the FOOOF object,
in the `gaussian_params_` attribute.



.. code-block:: default


    # Compare the 'peak\_params_' to the underlying gaussian parameters
    print('  Peak Parameters \t Gaussian Parameters')
    for peak, gauss in zip(fm.peak_params_, fm.gaussian_params_):
        print('{:5.2f} {:5.2f} {:5.2f} \t {:5.2f} {:5.2f} {:5.2f}'.format(*peak, *gauss))

    13.46  0.25  1.68        13.46  0.24  0.84

FOOOFResults
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FOOOF also has a convenience method to return all model fit results: :func:`get_results`.

This method returns all the model fit parameters, including the underlying Gaussian parameters,
collected together into a FOOOFResults object.

The FOOOFResults object, which in Python terms is a named tuple, is a standard data
object used with FOOOF to organize and collect parameter data.



.. code-block:: default


    # Grab each model fit result with `get_results` to gather all results together
    #   Note that this returns a FOOOFResult object
    fres = fm.get_results()

    # You can also unpack all fit parameters when using `get_results`
    ap_params, peak_params, r_squared, fit_error, gauss_params = fm.get_results()









.. code-block:: default


    # Print out the FOOOFResults
    print(fres, '\n')

    # From FOOOFResults, you can access the different results
    print('Aperiodic Parameters: \n', fres.aperiodic_params)

    # Check the r^2 and error of the model fit
    print('R-squared: \n {:5.4f}'.format(fm.r_squared_))
    print('Fit error: \n {:5.4f}'.format(fm.error_))

 .. code-block:: none

Conclusion
----------

In this tutorial, we have explored the basics of the FOOOF object,
fitting models, and extracting parameters.

Before we move on to controlling the fit procedure, and interpreting the results,
in the next tutorial, we will first explore how this model is actually fit.
