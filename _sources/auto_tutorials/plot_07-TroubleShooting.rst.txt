07: Tuning & Troubleshooting
============================

Tips & tricks for choosing FOOOF parameters, tuning fits, and troubleshooting.



.. code-block:: python


    import numpy as np

    # FOOOF imports
    from fooof import FOOOF, FOOOFGroup

    # Import some utilities, and tools for creating synthetic power-spectra
    from fooof.synth.params import param_sampler
    from fooof.synth.gen import gen_power_spectrum, gen_group_power_spectra
    from fooof.core.utils import group_three








.. code-block:: python


    # Set random state, for consistency for generating synthetic data
    np.random.seed(321)







FOOOF Settings
--------------

With default settings, FOOOF is minimally constrained. It defaults as such
since there are not universal settings that work across all different dataset
modalities. Appropriate settings also vary with power spectrum quality (noise,
or effectively, the smoothness of the power spectrum), and frequency ranges.

For any given dataset, FOOOF will likely need some tuning of parameters
for optimal performance.

To do so, we suggest using a combination of the following considerations:

- A priori constraints, given your data, such as the number
  of peaks you expect to extract
- Qualitative analysis, guided by examing the the plotted
  model fit results, as compared to input data
- Quantitative analysis, considering the model fit and error
  (however, see note at the bottom regarding interpreting model fit error)

Tuning FOOOF is an imperfect art, and should be done carefully, as assumptions
built into the settings chosen will impact the model results.

We also recommend that FOOOF settings should not be changed between power
spectra (across channels, trials, or subjects), if they are to be meaningfully
compared. We therefore recommend first testing out FOOOF across some
representative spectra, in order to select FOOOF settings, which you then keep
constant for the full analysis.



Tuning FOOOF
------------

With the defaults, FOOOF is relatively unconstrained, and therefore, most
commonly FOOOF will overfit, being overzealous at fitting small noisy bumps
as peaks. If you move to a new dataset, you may also find you need to relax
some settings, for better fits.

You also need to make sure you pick an appropriate aperiodic fitting procedure,
and that your data meets the assumptions of the approach you choose.

The remainder of this notebook goes through some examples of setting FOOOF
parameters to be most appropriate for various datasetes.



Interpreting Model Fit Quality Measures
---------------------------------------

FOOOF calculates and returns a couple metrics to assist with assessing the
quality of the model fits. It calculates both the model fit error, as the
root mean-squared error (RMSE) between the full model fit (`fooofed\_spectrum\_`)
and the original power spectrum, as well as the R-squared correspondance
between the original spectrum and the FOOOFed result.

These scores can be used to assess how the model is performing. However
interpreting these measures requires a bit of nuance. FOOOF is NOT optimized
to minimize fit error / maximize r-squared at all costs. To do so typically
results in fitting a large number of gaussian processes, in a way that overfits noise.

FOOOF is therefore tuned to try and measure the aperiodic signal and peaks
in a parsimonious manner, such as to not overfit noise, and following a
fuzzy definition of only fitting peaks where there are actually significant
peaks over and above the aperiodic signal, and the noise.

One way we tested this is by assessing the model as compared to how expert
human raters labeled putative oscillatory 'peaks'. As such, overall the
model is not directly designed to optimize model fit error / r-squared.

Given this, while high error / low r-squared may indicate a poor model fit,
very low error / high r-squared may also indicate a power spectrum that is
overfit, in particular in which the peak parameters from the model may
reflect overfitting by modelling too many peaks, and thus not offer a
good description of the underlying data.

We therefore recommend that, for a given dataset, initial explorations
should involve checking both cases in which model fit error is particularly
large, as well as when it is particularly low. These explorations can be
used to set parameters that are suitable for running across a group.
There are not universal parameters that optimize this, and so FOOOF
leaves it up to the user to set parameters appropriately to not
under- or over-fit for a given modality / dataset / application.



Reducing Overfitting
--------------------

If FOOOF appears to be overfitting (for example, fitting too many Gaussians to small bumps), try:

- Setting a lower-bound bandwidth-limit, to exclude fitting very narrow peaks, that may be noise
- Setting a maximum number of peaks that the algorithm may fit: `max_n_peaks`

  - If set, the algorithm will fit (up to) the `max_n_peaks` highest power peaks.
- Setting a minimum absolute amplitude for peaks: `min_peak_amplitude`




.. code-block:: python


    # Generate a noisy synthetic power spectrum

    # Set the frequency range to generate the power spectrum
    f_range = [1, 50]
    # Set aperiodic background signal parameters, as [offset, exponent]
    ap_params = [20, 2]
    # Gaussian peak parameters
    gauss_params = [10, 1.0, 2.5, 20, 0.8, 2, 32, 0.6, 1]
    # Set the level of noise to generate the power spectrum with
    nlv = 0.1

    # Create a synthetic power spectrum
    freqs, spectrum = gen_power_spectrum(f_range, ap_params, gauss_params, nlv)








.. code-block:: python


    # Fit an (unconstrained) FOOOF model, liable to overfit
    fm = FOOOF()

    FOOOF WARNING: Lower-bound peak width limit is < or ~= the frequency resolution: 0.50 <= 0.50
            Lower bounds below frequency-resolution have no effect (effective lower bound is freq-res)
            Too low a limit may lead to overfitting noise as small bandwidth peaks.
            We recommend a lower bound of approximately 2x the frequency resolution.

    ==================================================================================================


Notice that in the above fit, we are very likely to think that FOOOF has
been overzealous in fitting peaks, and is therefore overfitting.

This is also suggested by the model r-squared, which is suspiciously
high, given the amount of noise we expect.

To reduce this kind of overfitting, we can update the FOOOF parameters.




.. code-block:: python


    # Update settings to fit a more constrained FOOOF model, to reduce overfitting
    fm = FOOOF(peak_width_limits=[1, 8], max_n_peaks=6, min_peak_amplitude=0.4)
    fm.report(freqs, spectrum)

The synthetic definition is defined in terms of Gaussian parameters (these are
slightly different from the peak parameters - see the note in tutorial 02).

We can compare how FOOOF, with our updated settings, compares to the
ground truth of the synthetic spectrum.




.. code-block:: python


    # Compare ground truth synthetic parameters to model fit results
    print('Ground Truth \t\t FOOOF Reconstructions')
    for sy, fi in zip(np.array(group_three(gauss_params)), fm._gaussian_params):
        print('{:5.2f} {:5.2f} {:5.2f} \t {:5.2f} {:5.2f} {:5.2f}'.format(*sy, *fi))

    32.00  0.60  1.00        31.80  0.53  1.10


Power Spectra with No Peaks
---------------------------

A known case in which FOOOF can overfit is in power spectra in which no peaks
are present. In this case, the standard deviation can be very low, and so the
relative amplitude check (`min_peak_threshold`) is very liberal at keeping gaussian fits.

If you expect, or know, you have power spectra without peaks in your data,
we therefore recommend making sure you set some value for `min_peak_amplitude`,
as otherwise FOOOF is unlikely to appropriately fit power spectra as having
no peaks. Setting this value requires checking the scale of your power spectra,
allowing you to define an absolute threshold for extracting peaks.



Reducing Underfitting
---------------------

If you are finding that FOOOF is underfitting:

- First check and perhaps loosen any restrictions from `max_n_peaks` and `min_peak_amplitude`
- Try updating `peak_threshold` to a lower value
- Bad fits may come from issues with aperiodic signal fitting



Create a cleaner synthetic power spectrum
-----------------------------------------



.. code-block:: python


    # Set the frequency range to generate the power spectrum
    f_range = [1, 50]
    # Aperiodic parameters, as [offset, exponent]
    ap_params = [20, 2]
    # Gaussian peak parameters
    gauss_params = [10, 1.0, 1.0, 20, 0.3, 1.5, 32, 0.25, 1]
    # Set the level of noise to generate the power spectrum with
    nlv = 0.025

    # Create a synthetic power spectrum
    freqs, spectrum = gen_power_spectrum([1, 50], ap_params, gauss_params, nlv=nlv)

    # Update settings to make sure they are sensitive to smaller peaks in smoother power spectra
    fm = FOOOF(peak_width_limits=[1, 8], max_n_peaks=6, min_peak_amplitude=0.2)
    fm.report(freqs, spectrum)

You can also loop through all the results in a test group, extracting all fits
that meet some criterion that makes them worth checking.

This might be checking for fits above some error threshold, as below, but note
that you may also want to do a similar procedure to examine fits with the lowest
error, to check if FOOOF may be overfitting, or perhaps fits with a particularly
large number of gaussians.



.. code-block:: python


    # Extract all fits that are above some error threshold, for further examination.
    #  You could also do a similar analysis for particularly low errors
    to_check = []
    for ind, res in enumerate(fg):
        if res.error > 0.010:
            to_check.append(fg.get_fooof(ind, regenerate=True))

    # A more condensed version of the procedure above can also be used, like this:
    #to_check = [fg.get_fooof(ind, True) for ind, res in enumerate(fg) if res.error > 0.010]








.. code-block:: python


    # Loop through the problem fits, checking the plots, and saving out reports, to check later.
    for ind, fm in enumerate(to_check):
        fm.plot()
        fm.save_report('Report_ToCheck_#' + str(ind))

Reporting Bad Fits
------------------

If, after working through these suggestions, you are still getting bad fits,
and/or are just not sure what is going on, please get in touch! We will hopefully
be able to make further recommendations, and this also serves as a way for us to
investigate when and why FOOOF fails, so that we can continue to make it better.

You can report issues on Github `here <https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof>`_
or get in touch with us by e-mail at voytekresearch@gmail.com.

FOOOF also includes a helper method to print out instructions for reporting
bad fits / bugs back to us, as demonstrated below.




.. code-block:: python


    # Print out instructions to report bad fits
    #  Note you can also call this from FOOOFGroup, and from instances (ex: fm.print_report_issue())
    FOOOF.print_report_issue()

                   With a FOOOF object (fm), after fitting, run the following commands:               
                                 fm.create_report('FOOOF_bad_fit_report')
