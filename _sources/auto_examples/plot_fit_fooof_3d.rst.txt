fit_fooof_group_3d
------------------

The :func:`fit_fooof_group_3d` is a function that takes in a FOOOFGroup object,
which has been initialized with the desired settings, as well as a frequency
vector and a 3D matrix of power spectra. The FOOOFGroup object is used to fit
FOOOF models across the power spectra. A list of FOOOFGroup objects is returned.




.. code-block:: python


    # Initialize a FOOOF group object, with desired settings
    fg = FOOOFGroup(peak_width_limits=[1, 6], peak_threshold=0.5)








.. code-block:: python


    # Fit the 3D matrix of power spectra
    fgs = fit_fooof_group_3d(fg, fs, spectra)

.. code-block:: python


    # Compare the aperiodic exponent results across conditions
    for ind, fg in enumerate(fgs):
        print("Aperiodic exponent for condition {} is {:1.4f}".format(
            ind, np.mean(fg.get_all_data('aperiodic_params', 'exponent'))))

    Aperiodic exponent for condition 1 is 1.4027
    Aperiodic exponent for condition 2 is 1.3032


combine_fooofs
--------------

Depending what the organization of the data is, you might also want to collapse
FOOOF models dimensions that have been fit.


To do so, you can use the :func:`combine_fooofs` function, which takes
a list of FOOOF or FOOOFGroup objects, and combines them together into
a single FOOOFGroup object (assuming the settings and data definitions
are consistent to do so).



.. code-block:: python


    # You can also combine a list of FOOOF objects into a single FOOOF object
    all_fg = combine_fooofs(fgs)

    # Explore the results from across all FOOOF fits
    all_fg.print_results()
    all_fg.plot()
